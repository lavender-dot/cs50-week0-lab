My Scratch project has 2 sprites (Dee & Abby) playing catch (with a 3rd sprite which is a yellow beachball) on a Rio beach. 

To start, press the Scratch green start flag (top right). Then press 'space bar' to make Dee move (to a random position), and press 'down arrow' to make Abby move (to a random position). The beach ball will follow whichever sprite moved last. 

After you've played enough to have made the ball bounce 6 times, Dee will call out that it's time to go, Abby will agree and all 3 sprites will vanish.
